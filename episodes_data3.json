Harvey, initially in denial, is convinced that Donna will return to his side once the dust settles. However, the reality of Donna’s decision forces Harvey to confront emotions he has long suppressed, including his dependency on her support, both professionally and personally. Meanwhile, Mike and Rachel’s engagement takes a back seat as both are drawn into the complex dynamics at the firm. Rachel is deeply concerned about the impact this change could have on Harvey's mental state, as his reliance on Donna goes beyond mere professional convenience. As Harvey struggles to adjust to his new reality without Donna, he lashes out, leading to clashes with colleagues and raising concerns about his ability to function at his usual high standard. With the firm on edge, the episode sets the stage for a season where old alliances are tested, and Harvey must confront his vulnerabilities to move forward."
